                <p>Our inclination towards technology has brought about drastic changes in our lifestyle and owing to that, the mode of trading operations has also witnessed a great shift. This development in the technological world has completely transformed the ways how we used to make investments in the past. Instead of testing their money in stocks, people have now shifted their focus towards investing in cryptocurrencies and NFTs.</p>

<p>This investment model is being accompanied by a lot of new traders as they see it to hold a great future for them. On the other hand, a lot of platforms are developing their own cryptos along with exchanges from where traders can buy or sell cryptos. And, that is where a digital wallet comes into the picture. It works similar to the wallet that we use in our day-to-day lives to keep our cash. In a digital wallet, we can store our cryptos. And a few wallets also allow users to interact with DeFi apps and NFTs.</p>
